If you use you use mne.decoding.CSP, it would be interesting to know which parameter you use for component_order (‘mutual_info’ or ‘alternate’). This information would help to clarify which class/task variance each filter is maximizing or minimizing, and therefore have a better interpretation of the physiological patterns reflected by the selected components."

I also tried to remember where I was supposed to see an activation with this type of task, but I find it quite hard to choose, specifically when no distinct pattern emerged on the different CSP. Also, I supposed that the major pre-frontal activation that was on the different CSP was blinks, but maybe I was wrong.
